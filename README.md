## Overview

We begin with a baseline using sentiment lexicons and a Naive Bayes classifier, then introduce pre-processing techniques (e.g. stemming, stop-word removal), n-grams, and part-of-speech tagging. Performance is evaluated using cross-validation.

The analysis then compares Naive Bayes to Support Vector Machines (SVMs), followed by an extension using document embeddings via Doc2Vec (both Distributed Memory and Distributed Bag-of-Words variants).

The project also includes visual and quantitative analysis of the embedding space to assess semantic relationships and model interpretability.
